This is a basic to-do list web application.

There are four main files needed to run this application.

1. index.html. This file contains basic HTML functionality such as buttons and other page elements, and running src files.
2. app.js. This file runs functions which have been refactored in the todo-functions.js file.
3. todo-functions.js. This file contains the vital functions needing for running the application, including creating new to-dos, saving to-dos to localStorage, and DOM rendering.
4. uuidv4.js. This file contains a function that is used to give each to-do a unqiue reference ID, which is used for a variety of purposes.
